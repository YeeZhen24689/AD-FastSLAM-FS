# FastSLAM_Testing
The Goal of this Repo is to implement FastSLAM 1.0 on a differential drive robot to simulate its usage for mapping on a racecar.

# Using the Code
The differential drive robot simulation environment used is linked below:
https://github.com/jacobhiggins/python_ugv_sim

# Setting up the environment
The main code file should be outside of the folder of which you downloaded the differential drive robot repo.
